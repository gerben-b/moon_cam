# moon_cam
Moon_cam is designed to take pictures from the moon and planets. Moon_cam has a video mode that gives visual feedback while aiming the telescope on the desired target and while focussing.
When done, take either single pictures or bursts.
Moon_cam uses a number of libraries:
- https://github.com/mourner/suncalc
- https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy
- https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer

Without their excelent work, I would not have been able to create moon_cam.
